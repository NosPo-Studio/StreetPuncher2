# About
StreetPuncher2 is 1v1 street fighting game for the minecraft mod OpenComputers.
As the successor of [StreetPuncher](https://github.com/MisterNoNameLP/StreetPuncher) it mostly keeps the original gameplay while getting some complete graphics overhaul.

# Performance
The performance of StreetPuncher2 highly depents on the power of the CPU minecraft is running on.  
So if the game runns at low FPS running minecraft on a server or client with stringe CPU can help.  
But keep in mind that due to technical limitation of minecraft itself, FPS above 20 will not be visible.
